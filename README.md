# Pace University CS612 ReactJS Assignment

## Intro

This project was to write a small static single page app using ReactJS to show a blog site. 

The content are some old blogs I wrote and stored on blogspot.com

## Install

To run the site, you'll need an http server. Something like [Apache HTTP](https://httpd.apache.org/) or [nginx](https://nginx.org/en/). 

To install this project, copy all of the files from the WebContent folder to the http server's document root folder. You can either put it in the root folder, or create a subfolder, though if you use a subfolder, you'll need to include that in your url.
